# Expo Camera Conflict: Camera Unavailable Error

This repository demonstrates a bug where using `expo-camera` alongside another library that requests camera access results in camera unavailability.  The primary cause is a conflict in camera resource management.  The solution focuses on ensuring proper camera release and potentially using asynchronous operations to prevent conflicts.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error messages related to camera unavailability.  The exact error message may vary depending on the libraries in use.

## Solution

The solution implemented in `cameraBugSolution.js` addresses the conflict by implementing careful camera resource management, specifically ensuring that the camera is released properly when no longer needed. Asynchronous operations are used to avoid blocking execution and allow for smoother resource management.

## Technologies Used

* Expo
