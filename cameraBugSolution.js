The solution involves ensuring the camera is properly released after each use.  Here's a possible solution using async/await:

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

async function takePicture() {
  const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
  if (status === 'granted') {
    // Use the camera
    // ... your camera logic
    await Camera.stopCameraAsync(); //Ensure Camera is released
  } else {
    console.error('Camera permission not granted');
  }
}

// Example usage with an asynchronous barcode scanner:

async function scanBarcode(){
    //scan barcode here using some library
    await Camera.stopCameraAsync(); //Ensure Camera is released after barcode scanning
}

```
This improved version ensures that `Camera.stopCameraAsync()` is called to release the camera resource, preventing potential conflicts.   Error handling should be included to gracefully handle camera permission issues.
